"13","RAI","Accountability","string","NULL","Accountability of choosing / shortlisting the appropriate models lie with the Lex development team (like choosing BLOOM 17b, Stable Diffusion 1.4) with evaluations. Using the AI system through the authoring workflow lies with the content creators, reviewers and publishers."
"14","RAI","Security Vulnerabilities","string","NULL","Need confirmation of ISG – but the models in use are open source models – Stable Diffusion 1.4 hosted on Infosys AI Cloud and BLOOM 176b version on AWS SageMaker (later on Infosys AI Cloud) will not be sending any prompts to open internet models."
"15","RAI","Explainability","string","NULL","The augmented learning outcome is from Generative AI/LLM. Which has potential of hallucination and making up facts. Some qualification need to be made to adjust to the variation in outcome for different employees. For now, the tools we have does not address explainability challenges for LLM."
"16","RAI","Standard MLops Practices","string","NULL","There is currently no fine-tuning use case. So, MLOps would be restricted to hosting open models on AI Cloud and AWS Sagemaker and supporting prompt engineering through the common model-agnostic AI clous API layer. Need to extend to scaling use cases later."
"17","RAI","Bias/ Fairness","string","NULL","The LLM are only generating the content, which anyway is getting reviewed human SMEs, eliminating the fairness challenge to a large extent. Especially when it is only a learning content and focused on all Infosys employee. No personal information used to generate the content and hence bias related to users does not arise."
"18","RAI","Drift","string","NULL","Drift issue is limited to newer content generation using latest LLM models. However as SME validation is part of process, the drift detection and mitigation may be possible whenever needed. Also, system is designed to move to newer models as they are available. Process intervention need to be articulated here."
"19","RAI","Human touchpoints","string","NULL","The LLM are only generating the content, which anyway is getting reviewed by human SMEs before going live on the system."
"20","RAI","Robustness and Risks (Failure points)","string","NULL","The claim is only limited to reducing the time required for SMEs, it is not replacing any SMEs for any subject. The impact will be that content creation timeline will revert back to previous (what we have today). No risk of not coverage in any of the area currently being supported. "
"21","RAI","Privacy","string","NULL","Since there is no personal data involved for below used cases, DPO assessment is not required for these used cases with below riders.#No personal data will be processed for training the tool.#No personal data will be processed when the AI model is generating any content for any of the used cases."
"22","RAI","IP Protection and IP Infringement","string","NULL","Bloom and Stable Diffusion LLM models planned to be used and the contents generated are limited to Infosys usage, However when needed to be shared with client, the established approval process is followed. No IP concerns noted at this point."

"29","AI","End User Value","string","NULL","Since there would be developers with different levels of maturity in projects, these solution would bridge the skill gap among new developers. This frees of developer bandwidth to focus on innovative solutions."
"30","AI","Data Strategy","string","NULL","We are not using any data for training. How the data would be handled at microsoft end is explained as part of cognitive service documentation data ,privacy and security for Azure open AI service-Azure cognitive service| microsoft learn.The given prompt and reply from Azure open AI is preserved by the application so that users can revisit past conversations."
